### Hello

My name is Antoine Soetewey. I am a PhD student in statistics at UCLouvain. In parallel with my [research](https://antoinesoetewey.com/research/), I am [teaching assistant](https://antoinesoetewey.com/teaching/) for several courses in statistics and probability, and I give private [lessons](https://easystat.be/) to students and academics.

When I find the time, I also write about statistics and [code](https://antoinesoetewey.com/software/) in R on my [blog](https://statsandr.com/).
